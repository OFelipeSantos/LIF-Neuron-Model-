# Leaky Integrate-and-Fire Model (Ongoing)

This repository contains my implementation of a basic LIF neuron model as part of my self-study in computational neuroscience. I have been following at my own pace the Neuromatch Academy Python workshop in order to implement it. 

Current features:
- Membrane potential dynamics using the standard LIF equation
- Euler integration for numerical updates
- Voltage trace visualization with Matplotlib
- Implementation of time-varying input current
- Addition of randomness to input current (Exercise 7), introducing stochastic fluctuations that allow the neuron to spike irregularly


Planned next steps:
- Store simulation in lists
- Plot sample mean and standard deviation
- Introduce spike mechanism
- Evaluate the refractory period’s effect in spiking dynamics



This project is ongoing and will be expanded over time.
